This is the top level directory for version 6.5.0 of the NCL and NCAR
Graphics source code. 

This source can be used to build NCL or just NCAR Graphics. Note:
NCL depends on NCAR Graphics, so you will get both if you elect to
build NCL.

The documentation for NCL can be found at:

    http://www.ncl.ucar.edu/

While NCAR Graphics is part of the NCL source code tree, it has
its own documentation:

    http://www.ncarg.ucar.edu/
----------------------------------------------------------------------

We highly recommend that people install NCL using a precompiled
binary. We provide precompiled binaries for several flavors of LINUX,
MacOS, and Windows/Cygwin. Precompiled binaries are hosted on the 
Climate Data Gateway website:

   http://www.earthsystemgrid.org

Source code is also available in the same location.

Any questions or problems with installing NCL and/or NCAR Graphics
from source code or precompiled binaries should be posted to
